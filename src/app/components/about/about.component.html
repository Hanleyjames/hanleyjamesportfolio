    <h3 class="col-md-12 col-xs-12" id="header">Introducing... Me?</h3>
    <p class="paragraph col-md-12 col-xs-12">Hey there! I am a nomad, born in New York, raised in Florida and recently relocated to Washington State. I spent 90 percent of my life in schooling and reading books. I used to be interested in Political Economy because the notion of separating Economics from Politics is shortsighted.</p>
    <p class="paragraph col-md-12 col-xs-12">I have an A.A., in Human Services, a B.S., in Political Science, with a focus on Political Theory, and am one class away from finishing a second B.A, in Philosophy. My ideological Coordinates are a focus in Continental Philosophy with Kant, Marx, Lacan, and Deleuze. I don't read as much as I used to, but then again I needed a job that did not let me die of poverty. It turns out having disabilities and doing manual labor jobs can be quite detrimental.</p>
    <p class="paragraph col-md-12 col-xs-12">As of now, my primary hobbies are Bouldering, sleeping, cooking and working on programming projects for people with physical disabilities. I don't care about much else.</p>
